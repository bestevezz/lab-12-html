I plan to include a couple of things in my portfolio. Firstly I would like to include some of my personal and freelance artwork I have created. I think although this may not allign exactly with my goal and aspiration, it shows my well rounded-ness and my creativity, what I believe to be my biggest strength. I would also like to include a snippet of my first game I've made, along with the corresponding code. I also would like to include some code I've written for school, such as things for p5.js, arduino, and maybe things from this class as well. This would all be presented within the idea of the apps, so for the game it could have a game icon, for the code, it could have an IDE icon, and the art could be in a photo icon.
