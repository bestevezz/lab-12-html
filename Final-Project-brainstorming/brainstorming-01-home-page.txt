I think a good idea for a home page would be to have the layout either the same as an ipad, or a computer screen. With different sections being a different application and icon, allowing for interesting click events while also keeping it familar enough for people to understand. If this is meant to be used as a portfolio of sorts or a way to show off what I know, the combination of creating icons to be used can be the art, and the applications themselves such as games I've worked on, code I've written, or anything else can be its own applications. I think this would make for an interesting challenge as well as a way to try and be as creative as possible.
