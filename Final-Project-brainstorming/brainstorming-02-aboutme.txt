My name is Bryan Estevez and I am an aspiring game programmer and game developer. Currently I hold an associates in Digital Art & Design from Queensborough Community College where I graduated on the dean's list with a 4.0 GPA. I am continuing my education at New York City College of Technology where I am pursuing a Bachelors in Emerging Media Technology specifically on the Media Computation track. Although I am learning to program in school, I have taught myself as much as possible outside of school, in programs such as Blender, and Unity. In the next 5 years I plan to be working at a game development company, big or small, as a game programmer. 
    My work experience consists of a long time working as a senior camp counselor and afterschool tutor. In these positions, I was depended on for many of the activities done with the children such as thinking of themes of the week, games to play and keep the kids engaged, and I was resposible for up to 60 kids and around 8 other couselors. After that I worked as a project coordinator where I worked directly with a project manager to help accomplish our projects in an efficient and timely manner. After deciding I wanted to continue my education and go get my associates, I have done some free lance work for small businesses in helping them creatively, whether it be deciding on a logo, helping them with their company slogan, and other creative decisions. When it comes to my professional strengths, I am organized, detail and goal-oriented, a team player, and hard working. One of my biggest strengths is my creativity, for I believe there is no problem that cannot be solved with creative thinking. My biggest weakness is sometimes taking on more things than I should, not allowing for my best work to shine through. My skills include Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects, and Premiere Pro experience, as well as knowledge in languages such as C#, C++, and Javascript.
